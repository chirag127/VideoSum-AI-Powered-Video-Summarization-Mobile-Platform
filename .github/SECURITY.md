# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are committed to the security of our users and strive to address all security vulnerabilities promptly. We actively maintain and support the latest stable release of the **VideoSum-AI-Video-Summarizer-Mobile-App**. Please ensure you are using the most recent version to benefit from the latest security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage you to report any security vulnerabilities you discover. We value the security research community and will work with researchers to understand and address issues. Please follow these guidelines:

1.  **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly.** Wait for the issue to be fixed and a public announcement to be made.
2.  **Report privately:** Please send your vulnerability report to `chirag.codes@example.com`. Include as much information as possible, such as:
    *   The affected product and version.
    *   A detailed description of the vulnerability.
    *   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    *   Proof-of-concept code (if applicable).
    *   Your suggested mitigation or fix.
3.  **Acknowledgement:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **3 business days**. We will provide an estimated timeline for resolution if the vulnerability is confirmed.
4.  **Remediation:** Once a fix is developed, we will work to release it as a new stable version and will then coordinate with you on the public disclosure.

## Responsible Disclosure Timeline

We aim to adhere to the following timeline:

*   **Day 0:** Vulnerability reported.
*   **Day 3:** Acknowledgement of receipt.
*   **Day 7-30:** Vulnerability assessment and development of a fix.
*   **Day 30-60:** Release of a patched version, followed by coordinated public disclosure.

*This timeline is a guideline and may be adjusted based on the complexity and severity of the vulnerability.*
